# Network Infrastructure Best Practices for 2024

As businesses become increasingly digital, having a robust network infrastructure is more critical than ever. Here are the best practices we recommend for 2024.

## 1. Zero Trust Security Model

The traditional perimeter-based security model is no longer sufficient. Zero Trust assumes no user or device is trusted by default.

### Key Components:
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Micro-segmentation
- Continuous monitoring

## 2. SD-WAN Implementation

Software-Defined Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) provides:
- Better bandwidth utilization
- Improved application performance
- Centralized management

## 3. Structured Cabling Standards

Following proper cabling standards ensures:
- Easier troubleshooting
- Future-proof infrastructure
- Better performance

## 4. Regular Network Audits

Schedule quarterly network audits to:
- Identify vulnerabilities
- Optimize performance
- Plan capacity upgrades
